As we get closer to this year’s super bowl what’s on everyone’s mind is what the commercials will be this year. According to a 2021 survey a staggering 42% of people watch the super bowl for the ads. These ads generate upwards of 400 billion dollars per year, split between 70 different ad placements. Spending such exorbitant amounts on a 30 second slot begs the question “is it worth it?” According to Kantar research, the 2021 Super Bowl ads delivered an average return on investment of $4.60 per dollar spent, with ads for Mountain Dew, Verizon, T-Mobile, and General Motors achieving the best results. This year a 30 second commercial slot is $7 million dollars, doubling the rate from just 10 years ago. Super Bowl LV saw a shift in which industries were buying ads. Restaurants spent $33
million dollars in 2021, an increase of $28 million from the previous year. This is also the first time the industry, as a whole, had reached double digits in the millions, as brands worked to bring consumers back in doors during the pandemic. Automotive kept the number one spot, but beverages were outside of the top 10 for the first time since 2017, only spending $5.5 million as an industry. Creativity plays a critical role when it comes to Super Bowl advertising and highly effective ads can drive ROI into the double digits. In the midst of this evolving advertising landscape, marketers are grappling with the challenge of creating memorable and impactful commercials that justify the soaring costs. As the stakes and prices continue to rise, the Super Bowl commercials remain a captivating arena where creativity and strategic messaging collide in the pursuit of enduring consumer engagement.
