### 🏁 Garde: AI/ML Fencing Coach built using a bleeding-edge web dev tech and AI/ML tech stack 🤺

## 🚀 About Garde

Garde is an automated fencing coach being created alongside Davis Fencing Academy, a Team USA Fencing certified association. Garde aims to perform a robust analysis of a fencer's form and harness generative A.I. to give detailled feedback as to how the fencer can gradually improve themselves over time. In addition to this feature, Garde has recently implemented a feature which allows fencing coaches to access their students' videos and give them individual feedback as well as help them create fencing routines. We hope that Garde is used by leading fencing institutions not only in Davis and The Bay Area, but also worldwide as this program is truly one of a kind and is currently in the midst of being patented.

## 🥞 Tech Stack

Currently, Garde uses Next.JS and Tailwind CSS to create an intuitive and immersive frontend that clients can easily learn and adapt to. We are also planning to incorporate Framer Motion and other animation libraries to enhance user comprehension of Garde. Clerk is being used for user authentication as it's easily scalable and offers a seamless transition between the landing page and the pages which the fencer and coach can access. For the backend, Garde uses Amazon S3, MongoDB, Prisma, Tensorflow.JS, Plotly AND OpenAI API to store and fetch valuable user data, use ML to analyze and visualize fencer form, and use generative AI to give valuable feedback that the fencer can use.

## 🖥️ Code

Currently, Garde is patent pending and a lot of the code is private. However, if you are curious about the code for Garde and would like to have a sneak peek. Please contact Aggie Sports Analytics via email to schedule an appointment.
