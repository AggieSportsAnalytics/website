The Offside Detection in Soccer project is an advanced computer vision application that aims to accurately determine whether a player is in an offside position during a soccer match. Offside is a crucial rule in soccer, and its correct interpretation can significantly impact the outcome of a game. The project leverages the power of Python and various computer vision techniques to automate the offside decision-making process, reducing the reliance on human judgment and minimizing the potential for errors.
