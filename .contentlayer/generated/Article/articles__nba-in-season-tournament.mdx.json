    "raw": "\n# NBA In-Season Tournament\n\n<div>\n    By: Isabella Gonzales, Siya Pun, Niharika Suravarjjala, Matthew Chan, and Eric Kye\n    \n    December 6, 2023\n</div>\n\n---\n\n### **Introduction**: \n\nThe NBA holds a prominent position in the sports world, celebrated for\nits star athletes and exhilarating gameplay that captivates a wide\naudience. Over the past two decades, the league has witnessed remarkable\ngrowth, attracting exceptional talent from diverse corners of the globe.\n\nUnlike some sports leagues that reward consistent performance throughout\nthe season, the NBA places paramount importance on securing a single\nchampionship trophy in the playoffs. However, there's been a noticeable\nshift in recent years—while playoff viewership remains robust, interest\nin the regular season seems to dwindle until the playoffs arrive in\nApril.\n\nIn response, the NBA devised a unique initiative: the In-Season\nTournament, reminiscent of mid-season tournaments seen in European\nfootball. This tournament aims to rejuvenate excitement during the\nnon-playoff phase of NBA basketball and has garnered substantial\nattention, eliciting mixed reactions from both fans and critics. Our aim\nis to conduct an in-depth exploration of this tournament, delving into\nplayer performances, team standings, injury insights, marketing\nstrategies, and viewership trends.\n\n### **Viewership (Siya)**:\n\nIncreased by approximately 55%\n\nThe Lakers-Suns game attracted 1.93 million viewers, which was a 73%\nincrease from the Bucks-Timberwolves game in the last year’s equivalent\ndoubleheader (1.12 million)​​.\n\nThe Nets-Celtics game had 1.41 million viewers, a slight 4% decline from\nthe Bulls-Celtics game in the previous year’s equivalent doubleheader\n(1.47 million)​​.\n\nInaugural Tournament Interest: The initial interest in the new\ncompetition was solid, with the tournament's launch seeing 1.7 million\nviewers​​.\n\nThese figures indicate a significant interest in the NBA's new in-season\ntournament, with overall viewership showing a substantial increase\ncompared to similar time slots in the previous season. This suggests\nthat the tournament has been successful in attracting viewers and\nenhancing fan engagement.\n\nThe NBA has to be heartened by the In-Season Tournament’s early numbers\non TV. For the two Fridays that it has carried tournament games, ESPN\nviewership is up 55% vs. the comparable windows last season. And it’s\nnot just ESPN. Viewership of tournament games on NBA League Pass is up\n42% vs. the 2023 regular-season average to date.\n\n“ESPN had the honors of broadcasting the very first In-Season Tournament\ngame between the Knicks and Bucks and averaged 1.644 million viewers.\nThe Mavericks/Nuggets game in the 10:30 p.m. window averaged 1.76\nmillion.\n\nCompared to average NBA Friday night coverage on ESPN, viewership was up\n35% in terms of the In-Season Tournament.\n\nThe In-Season Tournament runs through December 9, when the final two\nteams will play for the championship in Las Vegas.”\n\n### **Marketing (Matthew):**\n\nIn order for the NBA IN Season Tournament to become successful, it must\nbe marketed. The tournament must draw fan engagement, but more\nimportantly, help the fans understand how it works so they stay\ninterested.\n\nFan favorite NBA players such as Richard Jefferson have helped break\ndown how the IN Season Tournament works by breaking down each component\nof the tournament. On top of that, companies such as Splash have\npartnered with its subsidiary RunYourPool to create contests on social\nmedia and connected TV to boost engagement with fans by giving them a\nchance to win tickets to the IN Season Tournament games.\n\nThe NBA has created brand new flashy courts to draw the attention of\nviewers. Not only has the NBA created brand new courts, but they have\nalso created a special new advertisement called, “The Heist”. It\nfeatured seven fan-favorite NBA All-Stars including Anthony Davis,\nDeRozan, Trae Young, Julius Randle, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, and\nDarius Garland plotting to steal the NBA IN Season trophy. To top it\noff, they also had Emmy award-winning actor, Michael Imperioli make an\nappearance. This commercial sparked a lot of excitement and buzz within\nthe NBA world and its fans.\n\nAlthough there was much joy with the tournament, it also brought a lot\nof controversy. Companies such as ESPN created a lot of buzz on their\nshow First Take with popular faces in the Sports World such as Stephen A\nSmith. They brought in a variety of NBA players to share their thoughts\nabout the tournament and all of them stated how ecstatic they were for\nit. Although the NBA players were thrilled, a lot of sports commentators\nsuch as Michael Wilbon, blasted the NBA’s in-season tournament as a\n“marketing ploy”.\n\nThe tournament sparked a lot of debate, but along with it, brought a lot\nof publicity for the tournament as well. Whether agreeing or debating,\npeople were constantly discussing their thoughts about the tournament\nwhich helped the NBA market it by sparking interest in people to see the\nturnout.\n\nTo further marketing, sports betting companies promoted the tournament\nby creating special betting deals to help get more people involved and\ninterested in the tournament whether they were watching it to win the\nbet or for their favorite players. DraftKings Sportsbook had a betting\ndeal where if you bet \\$5, win \\$150 in bonus bets and daily No Sweat\nSGPs guaranteed. FanDuel Sportsbook had another deal where bettors\nreceived \\$150 in bonus bets with a successful \\$5 moneyline bet and\ndaily profit boosts. BetMGM Sportsbook’s deal was up to \\$1,500 back in\nbonus bets if your first bet loses and Bet365 Sportsbook had bet \\$5,\nwin \\$150 instantly or \\$1,000 in first-bet insurance. The bets helped\ndraw in people who may or may not like the NBA to pay more attention to\nthe NBA In-Season Tournament.\n\nThe NBA has done an abundance of marketing from explaining how the\ntournament works so there is little to no confusion, creating\nadvertisements using fan-favorite players, making in-tournament specific\nproducts, generating a lot of positive or negative buzz, and finding\nways to interest those who may not be huge fans of the NBA, but instead\nbetting. According to Adam Silver, “The NBA In-Season Tournament is\nestimated to make about 1 Billion in revenue”.\n\n<img width=\"948\" alt=\"NBA Revenue Statisitics\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/6623a62b-5396-44df-b137-3511d7155aa5\" />\n\n_**Revenue for NBA Teams** - Credit to [Runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/nba-revenue-statistics)_\n\n### **Injuries (Niha)**:\n\nThe concept of an in-season NBA tournament, an idea borrowed from\nEuropean football leagues, presents an exciting twist to the regular NBA\nseason, promising to add an extra layer of competitiveness and\nentertainment. However, it also raises concerns about player health and\nthe potential increase in injuries. Analyzing the current injury\nstatistics of NBA teams can provide insights into how an additional\ntournament might impact players' well-being.\n\nAs of the provided data, notable injuries are spread across various\nteams. The Atlanta Hawks are dealing with injuries to Mouhamed Gueye and\nKobe Bufkin, with Gueye out due to a stress fracture in his back and\nBufkin expected to miss several weeks due to a thumb fracture. The\nBoston Celtics have Derrick White and Al Horford out for personal\nreasons and rest, respectively. The Brooklyn Nets are coping with the\nabsence of players like Dennis Smith Jr. and Ben Simmons due to back and\nhip issues, respectively.\n\nFor the Chicago Bulls, Lonzo Ball's ongoing recovery from a knee surgery\nis a significant concern, especially with him being ruled out for the\nentire season. The Cleveland Cavaliers have multiple players out,\nincluding Isaac Okoro and Ty Jerome, both sidelined for upcoming games.\nThe Dallas Mavericks are without Seth Curry and Maxi Kleber due to hip\nsoreness and a toe injury, respectively.\n\nThese injuries illustrate the physical toll the regular NBA season can\nalready exert on players. The introduction of an in-season tournament\ncould potentially exacerbate this issue. Players might face increased\nfatigue and a higher risk of injuries due to the added games and the\nintensity that comes with a tournament format. This format, while\npotentially thrilling for fans and beneficial for the league in terms of\nviewership and revenue, could lead to more significant wear and tear on\nathletes.\n\nMoreover, teams like the Los Angeles Lakers, with LeBron James, Anthony\nDavis, and several others listed as day-to-day or out, demonstrate the\nvulnerability even top teams have to injuries. The Memphis Grizzlies,\nwith six players injured, including key figures like Steven Adams and\nBrandon Clarke, highlight how injuries can impact team performance and\ndepth.\n\nIn terms of statistics, the average number of injured players per team,\nbased on the provided data, offers a glimpse into the current state of\nteam health across the league. Teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and\nMemphis Grizzlies, with five and six injured players respectively, are\nabove the league average. In contrast, teams like the Portland Trail\nBlazers and the San Antonio Spurs, each with one injured player, are\nwell below this average. This variance underscores how injuries can\nunevenly impact teams, potentially affecting competitive balance in an\nin-season tournament.\n\nThe potential introduction of an in-season NBA tournament must be\ncarefully weighed against these injury statistics. While the tournament\ncould bring excitement and a new competitive element to the league, the\nhealth and well-being of players should be a paramount consideration.\nThe league might need to explore strategies to mitigate injury risks,\nsuch as expanded rosters, more rest days, or even reducing the number of\nregular-season games to accommodate the tournament.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of an in-season NBA tournament is\nintriguing and could bring a fresh dynamic to the league, it also poses\nsignificant concerns regarding player health. The current injury\nstatistics highlight the existing challenges teams face in managing\nplayers' health throughout the season. Any plans for such a tournament\nshould be approached with a comprehensive strategy to ensure that the\nexcitement and competitive spirit of the game do not come at the expense\nof player well-being.\n\n<img width=\"707\" alt=\"NBA Team Injury Overview\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/c9794ac8-e5ec-496a-a66a-b9bcea108336\" />\n\n\n### **Player Statistics (Eric)**: \n\n<img width=\"701\" alt=\"PPG Leaders in In Season Tournament\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/e4b2ce28-1788-410b-a70e-646f2dedfe87\" />\n\n<img width=\"701\" alt=\"PPG Leaders in Regular Season\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/1d0acad0-9a88-4c27-91f7-a22b55612cc3\" />\n\n<img width=\"708\" alt=\"Scatter Plot of PTS for Top 10 Players\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/c59d197c-5359-45e8-ad16-0c39e2b81af9\" />\n\n<img width=\"687\" alt=\"Correlation between PPG\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/c1d33895-3db9-4421-b932-10be0cd0212a\" />\n\n_**Correlation between regular season ppg and In season tournament\nppg.

While regular season games are undoubtedly crucial for playoff\nseeding and overall standings, the tournament adds an extra layer of\nurgency and competitiveness into the mix. Teams are not just playing for\na win; they are vying for a tournament win and cash prize, and this\nadded incentive translates into a noticeable increase in player effort.\n\nOne of the most noticeable impacts of the in-season tournament is the\nuptick in game pace. Teams exhibit a more aggressive style of play. The\ncompressed format and the incentive of tournament success drive players\nto push the tempo, resulting in a faster and more entertaining brand of\nbasketball. The average pace statistic during regular season games so\nfar is 100.25 and the same statistic during tournament games is 102.\nThough it is small this increase can be felt by fans and caters to their\ndesire for excitement, leading to an increase in viewership as mentioned\nin the previous sections.\n\n<img width=\"666\" alt=\"Histograms of Pace\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/f1a0d075-b933-4a42-b95c-e0dad996da0c\" />\n\nWhile the defensive end increases intensity, offensive players also find\nnew avenues to improve. The condensed schedule and high stakes push\nplayers to unlock their offensive potential, resulting in an increase in\noffensive rating. The regular season average offensive rating of players\nwas 110.35 and the tournament average was 112.85, a noticeable increase.\nThe high of 155 is also significantly higher than the regular season\nhigh of 125.3. A similar trend can be seen with the defensive rating\ndata with a 2.74 point average defensive rating increase in the\ntournament.\n\n<img width=\"677\" alt=\"Histograms of ratings\" src=\"https://github.com/AggieSportsAnalytics/SoccerOffsideTracker/assets/54915593/c750b6f6-600c-4ba0-91d3-b12728f49e06\" />\n\nThe games on average has been closer in score during the tournament and\nthough this might be anxiety inducing for some fans, for most this makes\nfor a more exciting game thus increasing viewership. Overall the\ntournament improves the level of game play, raising the bar for players\nto continue to excel, and improves the viewer experience.\n\n#### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe NBA in-season tournament has proven to be a game-changer, injecting\na new level of excitement and competition into the regular season. The\nincreased game pace, defensive intensity, and offensive brilliance\ncreate a perfect storm of entertainment for fans. As teams vie for the\ntournament title, players push their limits, resulting in an elevated\noverall quality of gameplay that transcends the typical regular-season\nmatchups. The increase in viewership and media buzz will help the\norganization immensely and will be able to improve the organization's\nreach. The in-season tournament has created an annual spectacle that\ncaptivates basketball enthusiasts worldwide.\n\n_Edited by Abhi Sharma_",
